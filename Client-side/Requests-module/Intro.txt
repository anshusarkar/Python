Requests is a third-party Python module that 
you can easily download and install to simplify sending HTTP requests. It’s easy to use and has been around for a while, so it’s frequently chosen by developers. 
There are newer derivatives of Requests 
that are gaining popularity, like HTTPX and AIOHTTP.

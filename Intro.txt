Python, created by Guido van Rossum in 1991, is a high-level, dynamically typed, object-oriented,  interpreted , compiled , scripting language. 
Widely used in web development, data science, AI, and automation, Python draws syntactic inspiration from the ABC and Modula-3 languages. 
Known for simplicity and readability, it supports multiple paradigms and has a large, active community.

Note : As python is scripting language the script must be given permisiion to execute by using chmod +x in linux system just like shell script
       but for that #!/usr/bin/env python3 must the given as the first a in the script which set's up the python defualt environment

       Or can be executed from python shell ( called IDLE ) just like Jshell for Java (IDEL == "Intregrated development learning environment)

       Or alternatively can be executed using python3 filename.py in linux system 

       To envoke IDLE use py in windows terminal or use pythton3 in linux 




Terms and their meanings used :

                1) Interpreted : A prog lang is "Interpreted"
                   when it translates or interpretes from one language to
                   another example : Java , Python 

                   "And inspiration dosen't mena line by line execution"

                2) Compiled : A prog lang is "Compiled" when it
                   get's translated into the system understandable byte code 
                   
                   "Almost every language is "Compiled" though not every language
                   is "Interpreted" like C,C++"
                
                3) Dynamically Typed : A prog lang is "Dynamically Typed" when
                   The lang dosen't requires itself to awared of the data type
                   by an user 

                   example : Javascript , Python , shellscript

                4) Object oriented : A prog lang is "Object oriented" when
                   principles and concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP)

                   it's a praadigm that ode and data into reusable structures called objects
                   (object == an instance of a struct in c)

                   (praadigm = Way of writing )

                   these are the featurs of a object oriented lang :

                   Encapsulation: Bundling of data and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit, i.e., an object.

                   Inheritance: Mechanism that allows a new class to inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class.

                   Polymorphism: The ability of different objects to respond to the same message (method call) in different ways.

                   Abstraction: Simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors.

                   example of oop lang : Java , C++ , C # , Python , Javascript

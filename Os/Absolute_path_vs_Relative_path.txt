Absolute Path:

An absolute path provides the complete location of a file or directory from the root directory.
It starts from the root directory and includes all the directories in the hierarchy leading to the file or directory.
It is not dependent on the current working directory.
Example (on Unix-based systems): /home/user/documents/example.txt
Relative Path:

A relative path specifies the location of a file or directory relative to the current working directory.
It does not start from the root directory; instead, it relies on the current working directory as a reference point.
It is often more concise but may vary depending on the current working directory.
Examples:
./documents/example.txt (refers to a file named example.txt in the documents directory within the current working directory)
../parent_directory/file.txt (refers to a file named file.txt in the parent_directory, one level above the current working directory)
In summary, absolute paths provide the full path from the root directory, while relative paths provide a path relative to the current working directory. The choice between them depends on the context and requirements of your application.

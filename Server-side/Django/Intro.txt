Django is a full-stack web framework written in Python
Django is one of the most 
popular frameworks worldwide. 
Itâ€™s a free, open-source Python framework 
designed for building websites of any size, 
with any traffic needs. Django is sturdy and 
efficient, particularly because it makes use 
of reusable code. Django is also more secure 
than Flask, but Django software is much more 
unwieldy to work with. Developers may find 
Django slow because of the need to employ 
reusable modules and the need to check compatibility
against previous versions. 

YouTube, Instagram, Spotify, and 
DropBox were built with Django.

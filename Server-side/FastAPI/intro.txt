FastAPI is exactly what the name says: fast. 
Itâ€™s an open-source, high-performing web 
framework for building web APIs in Python, 
and it includes hints similar to those in 
Python. The main downside of FastAPI is how new it is. 
The FastAPI documentation is robust, but there is not 
as much in the way of external materials or community for 
Fast API as there is for Flask and Django. 

Netflix uses FastAPI internally.

Flask is a flexible and comfortable web development framework that is easy to set 
up and simple to use, which makes it good for beginners. 
Tools like template engines, for caching, and authentication help developers work quickly. 
But Flask handles requests sequentially, so although you can get commercial projects going fast using Flask, 
it isn't good for high load needs. Flask also uses third-party modules, which can make it 
prone to security breaches. 

Uber, Pinterest, and Twilio were all built using the Flask framework.

conda create --name "Enviroment--name" (without "")

conda activate "Enviroment--name" (without "")

conda env config vars set "Environment-name"="Your API key" (Without quotes)

conda deactivate "Environment-name" (Without quotes)

conda update "Environment-name" (Without quotes)

conda activate "Environment-name" (Without quotes)

In the code (API_KEY) is the name of the environment variable .. change it accordingly to the key name that would be given 

I meant that it in place of API_KEY there should be Environment-name .

import os

api_key = os.getenv('API_KEY')
print(api_key)  # This will print your API key if set correctly

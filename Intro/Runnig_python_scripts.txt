all the codes of python must be ran mentioning the bin directory at the top like this 

#!/usr/bin/env python3   (env part is python environment)

and must be made a system executable using chmod +x which stands for change mode for linux distros

after which the script can be run using ./filename

That applies on all scripting languages though the # portion may varry

for example it's

#!bin/bash 


though if not written in script both can done by using

python3 filename (for python) 

bash filename (for bash though might require the chmod command)

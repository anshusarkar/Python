Python, created by Guido van Rossum in 1991, is a high-level, dynamically typed, object-oriented, procidoral or functional,  interpreted , compiled , scripting language. 
Widely used in web development, data science, AI, and automation, Python draws syntactic inspiration from the ABC and Modula-3 languages. 
Known for simplicity and readability, it supports multiple paradigms and has a large, active community. (As pythyon supports multiple programing paradigms such as
OOP, procidoral that makes it multiple paradigm language like Kotline and java script which supports OOPS and procidoral programming).


Note : As python is scripting language the script must be given permisiion to execute by using chmod +x in linux system just like shell script
       but for that #!/usr/bin/env python3 must the given as the first a in the script which set's up the python defualt environment

       Or can be executed from python shell just like Jshell for Java

       Or alternatively can be executed using python3 filename.py in linux system 

       To envoke python shell use py in windows terminal or use pythton3 in linux and to exit use exit()

       IDLE is a IDE that can be installed using sudo apt command in linux  (IDLE == "Intregrated development learning environment)

       invoke idel using command IDEL

      Another way of way writing code is by using notebooks (ex - Doogle collab , Jupyter etc)

      they runs on a C# based kernel

      hence the extension ipynb which stands for "iron python notebook"

      Or just use vs code can do all of them 

Terms and their meanings used :

                1) Interpreted : A prog lang is "Interpreted"
                   when it translates or interpretes from one language to
                   another example : Java , Python , Javascript , ruby , Bash , Powershell

                   "And inspiration dosen't mean line by line execution"

                   and inspiration provides no need to compile the code as it gives complies it by it self though for some language 

                   like python makes it a little bit slower and for java the job is done by JVM which is more or like an interpreter

                   and "common language runtime" for C#

                   However interpretes are system specific and installs diffrent versions for eatch of them for different os

                   though c# and java are not really considered as interpreted by many some how !

                2) Compiled : A prog lang is "Compiled" when it
                   get's translated into the system understandable byte code 
                   
                   "Almost every language is "Compiled" though not every language
                   is "Interpreted" like C,C++,go and rust"
                
                3) Dynamically Typed : A prog lang is "Dynamically Typed" when
                   The lang dosen't requires itself to awared of the data type
                   by an user 

                   example : Javascript , Python , shellscript

                4) Object oriented : A prog lang is "Object oriented" when
                   principles and concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP)

                   it's a praadigm that ode and data into reusable structures called objects
                   (object == an instance of a struct in c)

                   (praadigm = Way of writing )

                   these are the featurs of a object oriented lang :

                   Encapsulation: Bundling of data and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit, i.e., an object.

                   Inheritance: Mechanism that allows a new class to inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class.

                   Polymorphism: The ability of different objects to respond to the same message (method call) in different ways.

                   Abstraction: Simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors.

                   example of oop lang : Java , C++ , C # , Python , Javascript

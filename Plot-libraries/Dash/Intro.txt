Dash is a Python framework for 
building web applications, particularly 
interactive web applications for data 
visualization. It's primarily used for 
creating interactive dashboards and data 
visualization tools.

All of the dash apps are made with A.I. and I know very low about Dash and I don't fully understand how it 
utilizes the html .

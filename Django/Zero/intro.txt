To start a django project install the django packgae using pip 
then yuo may and may notconfigure an environment variable 

After the installation  of django 
use command -> django-admin startproject "Projectname" (Without quotes)
which would create a new project directory with the given name 

TO run preconfigured server use command -> python manage.py runserver 

Django is  used to perform CRUD operations ->  C = create
                                               R = read 
                                               U = update
                                               D = delete

        Here is the file structure for the project and where to keep the templates and statics

    manage.py
    myproject/
        __init__.py
        settings.py
        urls.py
        wsgi.py
        asgi.py
        templates/       # Project-level templates directory
            base.html
            index.html
        static/          # Project-level static files directory
            css/
                style.css
            js/
                script.js
            images/
                logo.png

To start a django project install the django packgae using pip 
then yuo may and may not configure an environment variable 

After the installation  of django 
use command -> django-admin startproject "Projectname" (Without quotes)
which would create a new project directory with the given name

Django is  used to perform CRUD operations ->  C = create
                                               R = read 
                                               U = update
                                               D = delete

        Here is the file structure for the project and where to keep the templates and statics

Django works on MMVT architecture (Model View Template)

myproject/
    manage.py
    myproject/
        __init__.py
        settings.py
        urls.py
        wsgi.py
        asgi.py
        templates/       # Project-level templates directory
            base.html
            index.html
        static/          # Project-level static files directory
            css/
                style.css
            js/
                script.js
            images/
                logo.png
    myapp/
        __init__.py
        models.py
        views.py
        urls.py
        templates/       # Optional app-level templates directory
            myapp/
                app_specific.html
        static/          # Optional app-level static files directory
            myapp/
                css/
                    app_style.css
                js/
                    app_script.js

use command python manage.py startapp "app_name" (Without quotes) to make an app 

create a urls.py in the app folder

copy the contains of urls.py from the project folder to app folder's urls.py

use command `python3 manage.py  makemigrations` to create migration files based on the changes made to your models (database schema). 
These migration files keep track of database structure changes, such as adding new models, modifying fields, or deleting tables.

to run the actual database run python3 manage.py migrate
